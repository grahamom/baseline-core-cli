# @baseline-studio/cli

> CLI for the Baseline System — an AI-powered workflow system for product teams.

## Quick Start

Create a new Baseline System:

```bash
npx @baseline-studio/cli init
```

You'll be asked for your company name, then guided through context questions to personalize your system. When it's done, you'll have a complete system with skills, frameworks, and context files — ready to use with Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, or any AI tool.

## Commands

Once you have a Baseline System, the CLI is bundled locally. Run commands from your system's root directory:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx baseline status` | Show current version and check for updates |
| `npx baseline update` | Pull latest skills, frameworks, and CLI |
| `npx baseline context` | Re-run context prompts to update existing files |
| `npx baseline context add <name>` | Create a new context file and wire it to skills |

## How It Works

There are two copies of the CLI serving different purposes:

- **This npm package** (`@baseline-studio/cli`) is the entry point for first-time setup. It downloads temporarily via `npx`, runs `init`, and scaffolds your system.
- **The bundled CLI** (inside each system at `cli/`) is the daily driver. After init, all commands (`status`, `update`, `context`) run from the local copy — no npm dependency needed.

Updates come from git tags via `npx baseline update`, not from npm.
