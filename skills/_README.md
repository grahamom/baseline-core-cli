## What Skills Are

Skills are structured prompts that give AI tools domain expertise. They define methodology, quality criteria, and workflow patterns for specific types of work.

**Key principle:** Skills are universal. The same skill works with any AI tool. Context files make output specific to your business.

### Anatomy of a Skill

Each skill consists of these files:

| Component | What It Does | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Manifest** | Lists every file this skill needs | `[skill-name]/manifest.yaml` |
| **Skill File** | Methodology, workflow, quality checks | `[skill-name]/[skill-name]-skill.md` |
| **References** | Domain-specific guidelines and templates | `[skill-name]/references/` |

### What Skills Use from the System

Skills draw on the other components of the Baseline System:

| System Component | What It Provides | Location |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Context** | Your business knowledge (identity, voice, users, product) | `../context/` |
| **Frameworks** | Reusable patterns that skills reference | `../frameworks/` |
| **Examples** | Approved output samples that define the quality bar | `../context/examples/` or `[skill-name]/examples/` |

**The Baseline System = Skills + Context + Frameworks.** Skills create output. Context makes it specific to your business. Frameworks provide reusable methodology.

## Common Skill Overlaps

Some skills have similar names or adjacent responsibilities. Here's how to choose:

| Overlap | Distinction |
|---------|-------------|
| **Research vs Analytics** | Research answers "why" (qualitative interviews, synthesis). Analytics answers "what/how much" (quantitative metrics, dashboards). |
| **UX Design vs Prototyping** | UX designs solutions (flows, wireframes, copy). Prototyping makes them interactive and testable (coded demos, POCs). |
| **Product Communications vs Technical Documentation** | Product comms is internal (PRDs, specs for stakeholders). Tech docs is user-facing (help guides, release notes). |
| **Strategy vs Project Management** | Strategy decides what to build and why. PM executes how to build it (planning, tracking, sprints). |

## How to Use a Skill

### AI Coding Tools (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, JetBrains AI)

Just say which skill to use (e.g., "use my marketing skill to write a LinkedIn post"). These tools auto-read `AGENTS.md`, which reads the skill's `manifest.yaml` and loads every dependency automatically. No manual file loading required.

### Chat Tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

Chat tools can't auto-read project files, so you need to load files manually. Each skill has a `manifest.yaml` that lists exactly which files it needs. Check it for the complete list, then load the files into your conversation:

1. **Load the skill file** and its framework — from `always_load` in the manifest
2. **Load your context** — from `context` in the manifest (files in `context/`)
3. **Load references** — from `references` in the manifest (if the task needs detailed guidance)
4. **State your request** — the skill guides you through clarification → execution → validation

All skills follow the [Workflow Orchestration](../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) pattern for consistent execution.

## How to Create New Skills

Use the [Skill Building](skill-building/skill-building-skill.md) skill and its references:

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Skill Building Skill](skill-building/skill-building-skill.md) | Complete workflow for creating skills |
| [Skill Architecture](skill-building/references/skill-architecture.md) | Structure and components of a skill |

**Key requirements for new skills:**
- Reference [workflow-orchestration.md](../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) for meta-workflow patterns
- Include domain-specific quality criteria
- Define what context files are needed
- Keep universal (no Claude-specific features in the skill itself)

**Related:** See [Workflow Orchestration](../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) for the meta-framework all skills follow.
